Symbiodiniaceae metacommunity analysis

The R-scripts in this repository were used to analyse the composition on Symbiodiniaceae communities hosted by the coral Galaxea fascicularis. 
The community data is a count matrix created by amplicon sequencing of the ITS2 marker, the sampledata refers to a table with coral colonis in rows and environmental and host descriptors in columns.

- Boral scripts analyse the composition using Joint Species Distribution Modeling
- GDM script uses Generlized Dissimilarity Modeling
